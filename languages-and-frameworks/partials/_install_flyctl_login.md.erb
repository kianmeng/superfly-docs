## _Install Flyctl and Login_

It's time to install `flyctl`, the CLI app for managing apps on Fly.io. If you've already installed it, carry on. If not, hop over to [our installation guide](/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/). Once that's installed you'll want to [log in to Fly.io](/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/).
